        </center
            <p>Tom Cruise, born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York, is a renowned American actor and producer.
                 Over a career spanning more than four decades, he has become one of Hollywood's most prominent figures, known for his versatility and dedication to performing his own stunts. Cruise faced a challenging childhood, growing up in near-poverty with an abusive father. 
                Initially aspiring to become a priest, he discovered acting in high school, which led him to pursue a career in film.
                 He made his film debut with a minor role in *Endless Love* (1981) and gained attention with *Risky Business* (1983). 
                 His portrayal of a U.S. Navy pilot in *Top Gun* (1986) catapulted him to international fame. He continued to showcase his range with roles in *Rain Man* (1988), *Born on the Fourth of July* (1989), and *A Few Good Men* (1992).
                  Cruise is perhaps best known for his role as Ethan Hunt in the *Mission: Impossible* series, starting in 1996. The franchise's success solidified his status as a leading action star. In 2022, Cruise reprised his role as Maverick in *Top Gun: Maverick*, which received critical acclaim and was a box office success. The film's ensemble cast, including Jay Ellis, who played LT Ruben "Payback" Fitch, maintained a strong camaraderie, staying connected through group chats even years after filming.  

                 Cruise has been married three times: to Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, and Katie Holmes. He has three children: Isabella and Connor (adopted with Kidman) and Suri (with Holmes). His son, Connor, who leads a private life, recently celebrated his 30th birthday. 
                Beyond acting, Cruise is known for his philanthropic efforts. He was honored in 2007 by Mentor LA for his contributions and participated in the *America: A Tribute to Heroes* charity telethon for 9/11 victims. Tom Cruise's enduring career and influence in the film industry continue to make him a significant figure in Hollywood.
